    <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
       In metal typesetting, a font is a particular size, weight and style of a typeface, 
       defined as the set of fonts that share an overall design. For instance, the typeface
       Bauer Bodoni (shown in the figure) includes fonts "Roman" (or "regular"), "bold" and "italic";
        each of these exists in a variety of sizes. In traditional printing, 
       fonts were physically created using metal or wood type, with a font for each size.  </p>
